## 2025-02-09 - Performance Optimization: Intermediate Array Allocation
**Learning:** Using `Object.values(obj).reduce(...)` to aggregate values from a large object dictionary allocates a potentially large intermediate array purely for the iteration, negatively impacting performance and garbage collection compared to iterating with a `for...in` loop.
**Action:** Prefer manual `for...in` loops with an accumulator when aggregating data from keyed dictionary objects in performance-sensitive logic, rather than utilizing higher order array methods.
